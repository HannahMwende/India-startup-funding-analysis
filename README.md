# Analysis of Funding Received by Start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021

## Project Description

This data analysis
project focuses on the funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to
2021. The objective is to gain insights into the Indian start-up ecosystem and
propose the best course of action for our team's venture. By analyzing the data
on funding amounts, start-up details, and investor information, we aim to unearth
prevailing patterns and gain insights pertaining to the opportunities in the
start-up ecosystem of India in order to inform decision-making.

## The type of the problem

This project is of the exploratory data analytics and
visualization type as it is our aim to deduce hidden insights and patterns from
the available data.

## To guide our analysis, we have formulated 5 SMART questions:

1. What
   is the overall trend in funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to
   2021?
2. Which
   industries or sectors have received the highest funding during this period?
3.  What is the distribution of start-ups across the cities in India?

4. What
   is the average funding amount received by start-ups in India during this
   period?
5. Is
   there a correlation between the funding amount and the number of investors
   involved in funding rounds?

## We
have also developed three hypotheses for testing:**

·
## Hypothesis 1:

***Null:**** The
funding received by start-ups in India has **not** demonstrated consistent
upward trajectory over the years.*

***Alternate:**** The
funding received by start-ups in India has demonstrated a consistent upward
trajectory over the years.*

·
**Hypothesis
2:**

***Null:**** There
are no significant disparities in funding received by all sectors of the Indian
start-ups. *

***Alternate:****
The technology sectors receive higher funding compared to other industries.*

·
**Hypothesis
3:**

 ***Null*** *:
Situating a start-up in a particular city does not influence funding.*

 **Alternate** : Situating a start-up in a particular city significantly
affects funding.*

**To
test these hypotheses, we will conduct the following analyses:**

·
For Hypothesis 1, we will analyze the
year-by-year funding amounts and calculate the average growth rate of funding.

·
To investigate Hypothesis 2, we will
categorize start-ups based on industry and compare the funding amounts received
by each sector.

·
Regarding Hypothesis 3, we will examine
the distribution of start-ups across cities and deduce which cities harbour
most highly-funded start-ups.

## Conclusion

By rigorously examining
the data and conducting these analyses, we will gain valuable insights into the
start-up ecosystem in India. These insights will enable us to formulate
informed recommendations and determine the optimal strategy for our team's
venture.
