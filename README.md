## Project Description
>>>>>>> ac4ba4cb3ec10ac74e10c63e688c02e71159a416

This data analysis
project focuses on the funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to
2021. The objective is to gain insights into the Indian start-up ecosystem and
propose the best course of action for our team's venture. By analyzing the data
on funding amounts, start-up details, and investor information, we aim to unearth
prevailing patterns and gain insights pertaining to the opportunities in the
start-up ecosystem of India in order to inform decision-making.

This project is of the exploratory data analytics and
visualization type as it is our aim to deduce hidden insights and patterns from
the available data.

## To guide our analysis, we have formulated 5 SMART questions:
>>>>>>> ac4ba4cb3ec10ac74e10c63e688c02e71159a416

1. What
   is the overall trend in funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to
   2021?
2. Which
   industries or sectors have received the highest funding during this period?

3. 

What is the distribution of start-ups
across the cities in India?

4. What
   is the average funding amount received by start-ups in India during this
   period?
5. Is
   there a correlation between the funding amount and the number of investors
   involved in funding rounds?

have also developed three hypotheses for testing:**

## We
have also developed three hypotheses for testing:**

·
## Hypothesis 1:
>>>>>>> ac4ba4cb3ec10ac74e10c63e688c02e71159a416

***Null:**** The
funding received by start-ups in India has **not** demonstrated consistent
upward trajectory over the years.*

***Alternate:**** The
funding received by start-ups in India has demonstrated a consistent upward
trajectory over the years.*

·
**Hypothesis
2:**

***Null:**** There
are no significant disparities in funding received by all sectors of the Indian
start-ups. *

***Alternate:****
The technology sectors receive higher funding compared to other industries.*

·
**Hypothesis
3:**

 ***Null*** *:
Situating a start-up in a particular city does not influence funding.*

 **Alternate** : Situating a start-up in a particular city significantly
affects funding.*

**To
test these hypotheses, we will conduct the following analyses:**

·
For Hypothesis 1, we will analyze the
year-by-year funding amounts and calculate the average growth rate of funding.

·
To investigate Hypothesis 2, we will
categorize start-ups based on industry and compare the funding amounts received
by each sector.

·
Regarding Hypothesis 3, we will examine
the distribution of start-ups across cities and deduce which cities harbour
most highly-funded start-ups.

By rigorously examining
the data and conducting these analyses, we will gain valuable insights into the
start-up ecosystem in India. These insights will enable us to formulate
informed recommendations and determine the optimal strategy for our team's
venture.
